Machine Reasoning Project submission

Mortage process is the software program for automatically assigning the mortgage amount based on user's annual income, property price and downpayment.
It also sets the 'in limit' flag by checking whether the approved mortgage amount is enough to cover the sale price after the downpayment.  This program is
 enhanced based on the outcome of Machine learning knowledge discovery process, to automatically ascertain user's capability to repay the loan amount, 
before the Final Approver manually approves the loan amount. This rule is implemented using decision table, which assigns the 'in limit' flag as true,
 based on whether the user has a job or owns a house or both. If the user neither has a job, nor owns house, then the 'inlimit' flag is false. This aids
 the final approver in the decision process. The decision rules are set out to screen the key aspects of repaying capacity, which is the essential element
 of loan disbursment process.
